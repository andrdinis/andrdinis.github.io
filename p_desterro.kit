					"Salome goes out for another day at work, but not without bringing a definitive closure to
					a delicate occurrence."
				</p>
				<p>
					The short film is based on a subverted narrative through the chronological deconstruction
					of events. Throughout its 36 minutes, it explores the use of fire as a symbol — becoming a
					chronic element that corroborates as themes such as incest, platonic love, emotional
					dependence, delirium and anxiety appear. Perceptualized from two distinct diegetic angles,
					the story set in metropolitan Lisbon is confessed to the viewer through adages, which
					plastically reflects the disturbance and feeling of intrinsic persecution.
