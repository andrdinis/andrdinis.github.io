					Contextualized in sustainable design, and product of my final-degree project in high
					school, the base project chair presents itself as an alternative proposal to traditional
					compactable plastic chairs.

					Crafted from birch planks and a canvas fabric backrest, it is designed to be compact when
					packed or stowed. This equipment allows for low-cost manufacturing and transportation and
					enables mass production. Upon reaching the user, the same aspects implemented in the
					design promote its easy storage and cleaning — since even the backrest fabric, which
					benefits the comfort of this seat, is removable for washing.
