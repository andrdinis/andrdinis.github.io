				<p>
					The installation reconstructs a scenario from Western culture, reflecting Judeo-Christian
					values and traditions, personal experiences and prejudices related to death and the
					afterlife. It brings together at the table five pieces of electric light representing five
					divergent experiences - at the first post-life meal, served and observed by those who do
					not yet know what it is to die.
				</p>
				<p>
					The electric light is a symbol for the eternity of the who dies, while remaining in the
					minds of those who live - these represented by natural light. Among the electric light
					pieces are represented by means of the following titles, "Motivated Death", "Premature
					Death", "Natural Death", "Synthetic Death", and "Death Awaited" - in the respective order
					of the images above. The natural light, generated by the candles, is representative of the
					other two pieces that are not at the table. The duration of the installation depends
					exactly on these, which when blowned out close this funeral ritual, consolidating the
					celebration of loss.
