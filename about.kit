					<p>
						My work as a creative is not about the medium, but about the impact. Irreversibly
						curious and passionate about the human, the art and the technology.
					</p>
					<p>
						My artistic education started at the António Arroio School of Arts with Industrial
						Design, where I was introduced to design thinking, product concept and accessibility,
						through ergonomics. I then enrolled in a bachelor degree at the Faculty of Fine Arts of
						the University of Lisbon, where I studied Multimedia Art and Identity Design — deepening
						technical skills in areas such as interaction design.
					</p>
					<p>
						My academic experience converged into Digital Experience Design, which I studied in my
						post-graduation. Working in the different areas of art, technology and design has
						provided me with distinct skills that have shaped the way I think and create.
