					From the Latin “nest”, the title of the project is synonymous to natural receptacle — in
					this interactive installation, where a dance is set between the spectator and the art
					pieces, sounds of the environment escape human presence. Designed with the Lisbon
					Botanical Garden in mind, the installation provides an environment for reflection on
					deforestation in Portugal.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each of the four plinths has three electronic elements, which enable the soundscape system
					programmed with distance sensors, in ArduinoIDE and Processing. This system is housed by
					four archetypes of nests, built in selected woods — namely oak, eucalyptus, maritime pine
					and stone pine. A digital guide, in a web app format, allowing detection of distance
					between the viewer and the nests, offering the possibility to decipher where the sounds
					are fleeing, and how many sound variants exist, making the experience more immersive.
