					"Voyerism of endless rehearsals for a play, which one lives to practice, but never gets to
					perform. In a love behind the curtains of mouth: intentions intertwine with actions,
					failures send up pure truths, wheat and tares glistening side by side. Everything is
					golden to the eye of the beholder, even if shapeless to the reaper. The love narratives
					are innumerable, multifaceted, and the heartbreak of those who bleed in such essays is as
					or more red than the blood of those who succeed as protagonists. Blood pulls blood and
					hell is the scene of those who triumph and those who die in practice."

					The collection of photographs pays attention to the disagreement that exists between the
					traditional representation of love stories, and the experience of these. The 15 pieces
					depict clippings where the subversion of this representation is suggested through
					interpretation. The episodes portrayed are accompanied by titles that allow us to glimpse
					in which instance love is evident, but not in the format that seems automatically
					arranged. The light and contrast from which these images survive present themselves as a
					window to question what the observer himself experiences.
